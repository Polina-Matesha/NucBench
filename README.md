# NucBench: Benchmarking LLMs in Nuclear Engineering

**NucBench** is an open benchmark for evaluating multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) in nuclear engineering.  
It covers three task types:

1. **Reactor Operator Generic Fundamentals Exam (GFE)** â€” ~4,292 MCQs (PWR + BWR)  
2. **Undergraduate Nuclear Engineering Exam (curated by authors)** â€” 100+ mixed quantitative/qualitative questions across six subdomains  
3. **Two-Phase Flow Regime Images** â€” Bubbly, Slug, Churn, Taylor (external dataset)
