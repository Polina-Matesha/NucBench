# NucBench Benchmark

Welcome to **NucBench**, an open-access benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs in nuclear engineering.  

## Components
1. **Operator GFE Exams** → [exams/operator](../exams/operator/)  
2. **Undergraduate Exam** → [exams/undergraduate](../exams/undergraduate/) (coming soon)  
3. **Two-Phase Flow Images** → [images](../images/)  

## How to Access
- GFE exams are linked from the NRC official archive.  
- Undergraduate exam files will be added in structured CSV + PDF form.  
- Flow images must be downloaded from [Mendeley Data](https://doi.org/10.17632/nxncbzzz38.3).
